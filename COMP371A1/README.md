# COMP 371 ASSIGNMENT 1

## REFERENCE:
 The Shader Class is based from https://learnopengl-cn.github.io/01%20Getting%20started/05%20Shaders/

 Camera related code is refered from lab3.
## ASSIGNMENT DEMO NOTICE:

 Assignment instruction (W → move up, S → move) did not specify on which axis, so I choose z-axis to move or down. 

The requirement(a → rotate left 5 degrees about Y axis, d → rotate right 5 degrees about Y axis), snowman rotates itself at origion point about Y-axis, otherwise the entire body do orbit movement around the Y axis.

## CODING STYLE
The IDE that used in this assignment is Visual Studio 2019. If you see any syntex such as "pragma region", you can ignore it if the program can run well on your environment. Those are just used for code classification.
